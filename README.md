Social media platforms generate massive volumes of textual data
every day. Airlines in particular receive thousands of customer opin-
ions through Twitter, where users express satisfaction, frustration,
and service-related experiences. Analyzing these tweets can provide
valuable insights into customer sentiment and airline reputation.
This study investigates sentiment classification of airline-related
tweets. The analysis evaluates tree-based classification models and
their ensemble variants to assess generalization performance in
text classification tasks. Specifically, the comparison includes Deci-
sion Tree as a baseline, Random Forest as an ensemble of multiple
decision trees, and XGBoost.
